# How to set up Jupyterhub on Collaboratory (using ansible)
1. Create a secrets.yml file with the following fields filled in with valid authentication credentials.

```    
# Google OAuth Settings
# We are currently using the account 
# 'oicr-oauth@google.com' to set these two values
# using the credentials generated by the web API at
# https://console.developers.google.com/apis
oauth_client_id: <id>
oauth_client_secret: <secret>
    
# DACO Settings
# These need to valid credentials that allow a user
# application (such as jupyterhub) to query our
# DACO authorization service.
daco_base_url: 'https://icgc.org/ud_oauth/1/search'
daco_client_key: <secret>
daco_client_secret: <secret>
daco_token: <secret>
daco_token_secret: <secret>
    
# OpenStack Settings
# These need to be valid credentials to create 
# virtual machines in collaboratory
login_username: < valid openstack user >
login_password: < openstack user's password > 

# This must be the name of a SSH keypair that you've
# uploaded to your collaboratory account; it should
# also be the same name as the key file name in your
# .ssh home directory
keypair_name: <keypair name>
    
# Ansible Settings
# This needs to be the name of a user with ssh
# access to openstack; it might be the same as the
# openstack login_username field.
openstack_ssh_user: <ssh user >
```
2. Open a terminal window. Use **cd** to go into the same directory where you found this README file.

3. Type *cd var*, and edit the main.yml. Change the setting of the 'secrets_file' to match the pathname of the secrets file you just created.  

Lastly, go back to the same directory that this file is in, and type '**ansible playbook -i config/hosts jupyter.yml**'
